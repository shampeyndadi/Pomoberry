## Recordings, Storage & Privacy
Pomoberry was built with the idea of gifting encouragement, so your recordings and notes are handled carefully:  
- **Recordings** are uploaded and stored securely in **Supabase storage**. Each file gets a unique, private path.  
- **Access Control** ‚Äì Recordings are never public by default; they are retrieved through **temporary signed URLs** that expire after 24 hours.  
- **Notes** are stored in MongoDB alongside your Pomokey, linked only to your account.  
- **Privacy First** ‚Äì Nothing is shared with others unless you choose to gift your Pomoberry key.  
- **No Tracking** ‚Äì Pomoberry doesn‚Äôt sell or track your data; its purpose is motivation, not analytics.
